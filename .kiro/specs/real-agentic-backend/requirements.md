# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing MoE dashboard simulation into a real agentic system with actual LLM-powered expert agents. The system will replace mock data and simulated processing with genuine AI agents that can perform credit scoring, fraud detection, and ESG analysis using real language models deployed on cloud platforms with generous free tiers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Groq Cloud LLM Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to integrate Groq Cloud's ultra-fast LLM inference so that the expert agents can perform actual AI-powered analysis with minimal latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a request THEN it SHALL route to Groq Cloud API endpoints using the provided API key
2. WHEN an agent processes a request THEN it SHALL use Groq's supported models (Llama 3.1, Mixtral, Gemma 2) with real prompts
3. IF a Groq API call fails THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling with exponential backoff retry logic
4. WHEN making Groq API calls THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and track token usage for cost monitoring

### Requirement 2: Expert Agent Implementation

**User Story:** As a business user, I want specialized AI agents that can actually analyze credit applications, detect fraud patterns, and evaluate ESG factors so that I get meaningful business insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a credit check request is received THEN the Credit Agent SHALL analyze the data using domain-specific prompts and return a credit score with reasoning
2. WHEN a fraud detection request is received THEN the Fraud Agent SHALL evaluate transaction patterns and return risk assessment with confidence scores
3. WHEN an ESG analysis request is received THEN the ESG Agent SHALL assess environmental, social, and governance factors and return structured ratings
4. WHEN any agent processes a request THEN it SHALL return structured JSON responses with confidence scores and reasoning

### Requirement 3: Request Processing Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust request processing pipeline so that incoming requests are properly queued, routed, and processed by the appropriate agents with proper error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate the request format and queue it for processing
2. WHEN the MoE router receives a queued request THEN it SHALL determine the appropriate agent(s) based on request type and current load
3. WHEN an agent is selected THEN the system SHALL execute the agent with proper timeout and retry logic
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL update the request status and broadcast results via WebSocket
5. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and update request status appropriately

### Requirement 4: Groq Cloud Deployment Support

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to be optimized for Groq Cloud's infrastructure so that we can leverage their ultra-fast inference speeds and generous free tier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying with Groq Cloud THEN the system SHALL integrate with Groq's API endpoints and handle their specific rate limits (30 requests/minute on free tier)
2. WHEN selecting models THEN the system SHALL support Groq's available models including Llama 3.1 70B, Mixtral 8x7B, and Gemma 2 9B
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL use environment variables for the Groq API key and model preferences
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate the Groq API key and test connectivity before accepting requests

### Requirement 5: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want real-time monitoring of actual LLM performance metrics so that I can track costs, latency, and success rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an LLM call is made THEN the system SHALL track response time, token usage, and costs
2. WHEN agents are processing THEN the system SHALL update real CPU and memory metrics instead of simulated values
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including provider, model, and failure reason
4. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL display actual performance metrics from real LLM calls

### Requirement 6: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration options so that I can easily switch between LLM providers, adjust model parameters, and manage costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL support multiple LLM providers simultaneously with priority ordering
2. WHEN an agent is configured THEN it SHALL allow customization of model selection, temperature, max tokens, and other parameters
3. WHEN cost limits are set THEN the system SHALL track usage and pause processing when limits are reached
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL reload settings without requiring a restart
